# Self-Study Roadmap

I have developed a self-study roadmap to become a software developer.
This roadmap includes a list of courses that I will be taking, in the order I will be taking them.
All of these courses are offered by Udemy.

I have also included a brief overview of the learning objectives for each course, as well as checkboxes to indicate my learning progress.
